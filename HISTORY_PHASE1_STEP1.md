# Phase 1 Step 1 History: Fix 7z Compilation Errors

## Issue Encountered
The 7z archive implementation has severe structural issues from previous refactoring:
- Brace mismatches in the `extract` method around lines 940-997
- Undefined variables like `entry_path`, `files_processed`, `total_files`, `bytes_processed`
- Incomplete if-else blocks and method structures
- Multiple nested closures with missing braces

## Root Cause
During the sevenz-rust API migration, old code fragments were left behind creating:
1. Mismatched braces from incomplete cleanup
2. References to variables that don't exist in the new API structure
3. Broken control flow structures

## Solution Approach
Need to completely rebuild the 7z extract method using the working pattern from other formats:
1. Use the sevenz-rust helper functions (decompress_file, decompress_file_with_password)
2. Remove all broken legacy code fragments
3. Implement a clean, simple extraction method similar to the working list_entries method

## Plan Modification
Instead of trying to patch the broken code, I'll replace the entire extract method implementation with a clean version that follows the established pattern.

## Time Impact
This will add ~30 minutes to Phase 1 but ensures a solid foundation for subsequent phases.
