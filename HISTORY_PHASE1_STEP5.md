# Phase 1 Step 5 History: Enhanced Error Handling and Progress Reporting

## Success Achieved
Successfully implemented comprehensive error handling and progress reporting system for archive operations:

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Enhanced ProgressInfo Structure**:
   - Added `operation: ProgressOperation` - Type of operation (Extracting, Listing, Verifying, etc.)
   - Added `speed_bps: Option<u64>` - Real-time processing speed in bytes per second
   - Added `eta_seconds: Option<u64>` - Estimated time remaining in seconds
   - Added `stage: ProgressStage` - Current operation stage (Initializing, Processing, Finalizing, etc.)
   - Added `status_message: Option<String>` - Optional detailed status message

2. **ProgressOperation Enum**:
   - `Extracting` - File extraction operations
   - `Listing` - Directory/archive listing operations
   - `Verifying` - Integrity verification operations
   - `Compressing` - Archive creation operations
   - `Counting` - File/size counting operations

3. **ProgressStage Enum**:
   - `Initializing` - Preparation phase
   - `Processing` - Main operation phase
   - `Finalizing` - Cleanup and completion phase
   - `Completed` - Operation finished successfully
   - `Cancelled` - Operation was cancelled
   - `Failed` - Operation failed with errors

4. **ProgressTracker Utility**:
   - `new(operation: ProgressOperation)` - Initialize with operation type
   - `create_progress()` - Generate enhanced progress info with speed/ETA calculations
   - **Speed Calculation**: Real-time bytes per second based on elapsed time
   - **ETA Calculation**: Estimated time remaining based on current progress rate
   - **Timing**: Tracks start time, last update time, and last byte count

5. **ErrorContext Structure**:
   - `error_type: ArchiveError` - Original error information
   - `operation_context: String` - Description of what operation was being performed
   - `recovery_suggestions: Vec<String>` - Actionable recovery suggestions for users
   - `severity: ErrorSeverity` - Error severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - `is_recoverable: bool` - Whether the error can be recovered from
   - `user_friendly_message: String` - Human-readable error explanation

6. **ErrorSeverity Enum**:
   - `Low` - Minor issues that don't prevent operation
   - `Medium` - Issues that may impact performance
   - `High` - Serious issues requiring user attention
   - `Critical` - Fatal errors that prevent operation completion

7. **ErrorHandler Utility**:
   - `create_context()` - Generate error context with recovery suggestions
   - `is_recoverable()` - Determine if error is recoverable
   - `user_friendly_message()` - Create user-friendly error messages
   - **Recovery Suggestions**: Contextual suggestions based on error type and operation

8. **Enhanced Archive Error Variants**:
   - `OperationCancelled` - User cancelled the operation
   - `InsufficientDiskSpace` - Not enough disk space for operation
   - `FormatValidationFailed` - Archive format validation failed
   - `NetworkError` - Network-related errors (for remote archives)

### Technical Implementation Details

**ProgressTracker Algorithm**:
- Maintains timing state between progress updates
- Calculates speed as `(bytes_processed - last_bytes) / elapsed_seconds`
- Estimates ETA as `(total_bytes - bytes_processed) / current_speed`
- Handles edge cases like zero elapsed time and zero speed

**ErrorHandler Logic**:
- Maps specific error types to appropriate recovery suggestions
- Determines recoverability based on error nature and context
- Generates user-friendly messages with actionable advice
- Considers operation context to provide relevant suggestions

**Progress Tracking Integration**:
- Updated all archive implementations (ZIP, TAR, 7z) to use ProgressTracker
- Added initialization, processing, and completion progress stages
- Maintains consistent progress reporting across all archive formats
- Provides real-time speed and ETA feedback during operations

### Updated Archive Implementations

**ZIP Archive**: 
- Progress tracking throughout extraction loop
- Speed/ETA calculations for large archives
- Stage-based progress reporting (Initialize → Process → Complete)

**TAR Archive**: 
- Basic progress tracking (due to tar crate limitations)
- Initialization and completion progress reports
- Consistent with other archive formats

**7z Archive**:
- Completion progress tracking
- Integration with sevenz-rust extraction
- Enhanced error context for 7z-specific issues

### Error Context Examples

```rust
// Example recovery suggestions by error type:
NotFound => vec![
    "Verify the file path is correct",
    "Check if the file was moved or deleted",
    "Ensure you have read permissions for the file"
]

InsufficientDiskSpace => vec![
    "Free up disk space and try again", 
    "Extract to a different location with more space",
    "Select fewer files to extract"
]

PasswordRequired => vec![
    "Provide the correct password for the archive",
    "Contact the archive creator if password is unknown"
]
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Speed Calculation**: Real-time with sub-second accuracy
- **ETA Calculation**: Updates dynamically based on current throughput
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal overhead for progress tracking
- **Thread-Safe**: Safe for use in async/concurrent environments

## Integration Points
- **Archive Trait**: All progress callbacks use enhanced ProgressTracker
- **Error System**: Unified error handling with contextual recovery suggestions
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for operation types and stages
- **Future Ready**: Extensible for additional operation types and error contexts

## Next Steps
- Create comprehensive test suite for all archive formats
- Test error handling and recovery suggestion accuracy  
- Validate progress tracking accuracy across different file sizes
- Add integration tests for real-world archive operations
