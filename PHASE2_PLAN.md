## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Rust) Enhancements
```rust
// Enhanced core-engine
pub struct LocalFileSystem {
    watcher: Option<RecommendedWatcher>,
    performance_cache: HashMap<PathBuf, DirectoryCache>,
}

// Search engine implementation  
pub struct SearchEngine {
    indexer: ContentIndexer,
    pattern_matcher: PatternMatcher,
    result_streamer: ResultStreamer,
}

// Archive support
pub struct ArchiveReader {
    format_handlers: HashMap<String, Box<dyn ArchiveHandler>>,
    extraction_progress: ProgressReporter,
}
```

### Frontend (React) Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced command system
export class FileOperationCommand extends Command {
  async execute(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void> {
    // With progress reporting and error handling
  }
}

// Search integration
export const useSearch = () => {
  // Real-time search hook with debouncing
}

// Archive browsing
export const ArchiveViewer = ({ archivePath }: Props) => {
  // Component for browsing archives
}
```

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Requirements
- All new code must have corresponding tests
- ESLint v9 compliance (no new warnings)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Rust clippy compliance

### Performance Requirements
- Directory listing: <100ms for 10K files
- Search: <2s for 1M+ files on SSD
- File operations: Progress feedback for operations >1s
- Memory usage: <200MB for large directories

### User Experience Requirements
- All destructive operations require confirmation
- Progress indicators for operations >500ms
- Error messages provide actionable feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts work consistently

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for each crate (core-engine, search-engine, archive)
- Integration tests for command handlers
- Performance tests for large directory operations
- Error handling tests for edge cases

### Frontend Testing
- Component tests for new UI elements
- Integration tests for command flows
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Accessibility tests for all interactive elements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Copy, move, delete, rename operations work
- [ ] Search finds files quickly and accurately
- [ ] Archive browsing and extraction works
- [ ] Progress indicators show for long operations
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- [ ] Drag and drop functionality works smoothly

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rust async complexity**: Start with simple implementations, iterate
- **Performance with large files**: Implement streaming and chunking
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Test on all target platforms
- **Memory usage**: Profile and optimize critical paths

### Implementation Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined MVP for each feature
- **Testing complexity**: Write tests alongside implementation
- **Integration issues**: Regular integration testing throughout

## Success Metrics
