## Integration Points

### Tauri Backend Integration
```typescript
// Example integration with Tauri commands
const handleTest = async (connection: RemoteConnection) => {
  const success = await invoke('test_remote_connection', { config: connection });
  return success;
};

const handleConnect = async (connectionId: string) => {
  await invoke('connect_remote', { connectionId });
};
```

### Credential Storage Integration
- **Secure Storage**: Integration with OS keychain through credential manager
- **Automatic Saving**: Credentials stored securely on connection creation/edit
- **Password Protection**: Sensitive data never stored in plain text
- **Migration Support**: Seamless credential migration between versions

### State Management
```typescript
// Redux integration for connection state
interface ConnectionState {
  connections: RemoteConnection[];
  activeConnections: Set<string>;
  testResults: Record<string, TestResult>;
  isManagerOpen: boolean;
}
```
